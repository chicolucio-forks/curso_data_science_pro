# Data Science Pro

My annotations and studies on the Data Science Pro course.
    
[Course data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15f1t4fGEFA7ZK_N2S_4rse-T-IGg_xjV). Unzip to a `data` folder at the project root.

The `yml` files are conda environment files that others can use to replicate the environment with all the necessary packages. One of them has the [`pandas-profiling`](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) package and its dependencies. It is not obligatory but it is useful.

The `aulas` folder has the original material from the course instructor. The `files` folder has images imported in some notebooks. My annotations and studies are in the `explore` folder.
